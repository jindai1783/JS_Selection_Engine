# JS Selection Engine

## Introduction

This repo is a note of building a JS selection engine that works like JQuery.

It has been built with the following principles:

**DRY principle:** every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. The functions are at their minimum.

**KISS principle:** most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. The most easy-to-read syntax is used.

**YAGNI principle:** a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. The code is designed to pass the test and no more.
