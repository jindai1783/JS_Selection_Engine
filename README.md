# JS Selection Engine

## Introduction

This repo is a note of building a JS selection engine that works like JQuery. It has been built with the following principles:

**DRY principle:** every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. The functions are at their minimum.

**KISS principle:** most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. I have only chosen the  most easy-to-read syntax.

**YAGNI principle:** a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. The code is designed to pass the test and no more.


---update---

**Backward compatible:** if IE8 is detected, missing functions will be added to support the browser so the script is still functional.
